                ramifications of the Global Covid19 pandemic nd its effects on the Lebanese economy. The poorst in Lebanon live on the equivalent of 3$ a day or
                $90 a month, while around 400,000 Lebanese live on $1 a day.Those were the figures from before the onset of the current economic situation.
